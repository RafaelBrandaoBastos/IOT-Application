# IOT Academic Project

I, as an user, want a custom page for error 404 - Page not found.

## Objectives

The main parts of the template are:

* Use sensors to monitor the environment and the soil, together with an actuator to irrigate the garden.
* Connect the ESP 32 via WI-FI, allowing the sending and receiving of messages via MQTT in a timely manner
* Creating events triggered by receiving data in MQTT
* Creation of the database to store the collected data
* Mobile interface creation
